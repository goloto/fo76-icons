[b][size=4]About this mod[/size]
[/b]
This mod is an alternative to [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146]IconSortingTags[/url]﻿, but with fewer icons.

My main goals are: different style, more simple and readable UI and few other improvements without loss of functionality.


[b][size=4]Installation[/size]
[/b]
Installation is same as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146]IconSortingTags[/url]﻿.

[b]WARNING![/b] You need to follow steps 4-11 after each game update.

[list=1]
[*]Install latest version of [xTranslator](http://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/313)
[*]Open xTranslator and choose Fallout 76
[*]Open `Options` -> `Dictionary and languages` window. Set `Source language`, `Destination language` parameters to your current game language and `./data` and `./strings/` parameters to `Data` folder in your current game directory. After setting those parameters xTranslator should not display any errors in this window.
[*]Select SeventySix.esm in `File` -> `Load Esp/Esm`
[*]Extract mod files in `Data/Interface` folder in your current game directory
[*]Open `Wizards` -> `HeaderProcessor Wizrd` window
[*]Click `Create ba2 backup` for creating backup files
[*]Make sure, that game path and language on step 1 and 2 are correct
[*]Click `Load Rules` on step 3 and chose file `HeaderRules.txt` from mod files
[*]Click `Run Processor` on step 6 and wait until it's complete
[*]Click `Patch game files` on step 7 and wait until it's complete

[b][size=4]Troubleshooting[/size]
[/b]
- If there are `LOOKUP FAILED` messages in the game, you need to re-install mod
- If there are squares instead of icons, most likely you forgot to complete step 11


[b][size=4]Key features[/size]
[/b]
- icons for new events and items, including Big Bloom, fishing, legendary mods, canned cooked food, mystery boxes and other
- icons for item sources (events, vendors, raids etc.)

Most of the icons are generated with [url=http://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev]flux.1-dev[/url] and then mannually modified by myself.

All of fonts, icons and source code are available at [url=http://github.com/goloto/fo76-icon-tags]GitHub[/url]﻿ by MIT and OFL licenses.
